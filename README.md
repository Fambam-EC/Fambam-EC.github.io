### Informal Code Review

Follow this [code review link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cc_g1UeDz6uWrgaCRTW6o_uYW2qJjXfD/view?usp=sharing) to see me analyze my exisiting projects to arrange and initiate an improvement plan.  The plans in the code review were implemented in the artifacts below to prove proficiency in navigating and incorporating aspects of Computer Science with respect to development in line with a plan and flawless execution.

## Artifact Narratives

### Full Stack Travlr Application

I chose to include my Full Stack Application since it broadcasted a lot of my skills, it was a two part elective 400 top level course, and it is through this project that I learned the most on structure, frameworks, Model View Controller development, and interaction with MongoDB.  I also included it because the second part of the course was a great introduction and deployment of the app in the AWS console.  This artifact was taken from my previous term, with some competency inclusions from the current term I am in which has been my first experience within AWS Console.  This artifact basically brings all of my computer science experiences together in a culmination of skills and abilities with languages, frameworks, version control through Git, and how to publish Software securely to AWS.  I can basically create a full stack application within minutes and have it deployed to the cloud.  Obviously it would take a long time to refine the pages and make everything look nice, but it is impressive nonetheless.

Improving the application was difficult at first, but it drove home many key competencies that I needed to refine a bit to make sure everything was operating smoothly.  One specific thing I learned was to make sure that I have the MVC routes exported and imported correctly in certain parts of the application.  Forgetting one simple missing or extra ";" can take down an entire project.  Fortunately those mistakes, albeit frustrating, can be minimized by deliberate testing.  I also had trouble importing images correctly, but realized that they are case sensitive and you also need the right extension.  I know another minor error, but one that I needed to focus and elimnate.  One awesome thing working in Visual Code whenever you save, your development server in Angular would refresh and rebuild itself.  I know that is typical with nodemon and other services, but that one was indeed helpful.  I made sure to confirm my enhancements with the instructor and made sure to highlight where those enhancements contributed to the specific rubric criteria for the final ePortfolio Project.  This application was my star project, and even though it is basic in itself, it blew the hinges off the door of my untapped potential.  I am beyond excited to see what I am able to accomplish with this and other projects in the future.    

### DASH Application

My DASH application was not as robust and was a lesser demonstration of complete skills when compared to my Full Stack Application.  This artifact was created in Client-Server Development which I took a few months ago.  Despite it not being as robust it still helped me to show competencies in line with the final project rubric.  It specifically showed my proficiency with working with another language besides HTML, Javascript and Java, which was Python.  Python, although seemingly very human readable, can be very tricky with syntax.  Another reason I chose this artifact was the way I had to show my skills in even creating the right environment for which to render my project.  The long list of dependencies and libraries I needed to get included but not limited to, MongoDB with a database and complete collection of data (which I had to get Mongo Tools to even import...), Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Dash with the various extra tools within Dash  needed.  I think being able to recreate that environment was proof of Computer Science aptitude by itself, but I still had to improve it.

Improving the application was tough in trying to align to course rubric criteria, but I believe I showed enough skills.  I had to finish my CRUD operations, as when I completed that term it was not quite complete enough to earn full credit for that project.  The toughest part about finishing the CRUD operations was the converting of data types to display and work correctly, especially when working with cursor objects.  I was able to successfully finish the CRUD operations, which doing in Python will help me in other languages as well.  Java is my preferred language, but just being able to create something that functions well is a passion of mine, regardless of tha language.  Working on this portfolio and the artifacts has reawakened my passion for development.  To be quite frank, doing the projects for school is great to learn and grow, but turning onesself loose on a project, for lack of a better term, reignited my spirit of creation and debugging.  Once there was not a specific "script" (punny), I enjoyed working in the projects and accomplishing something of value.

Here is a link [projects](https://fambam-ec.github.io/projects.html)to another page of my portfolio that is currently in progress.  Click on it if you wish, as I may have already been working to improve it by the time you see it.
